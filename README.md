# Implementation of some Bayesian Filters for structural system identification

The present study deals with three different methods for structural identification: the Kalman Filter, the Unscented Kalman Filter and the Particle Filter. The Kalman Filter is a known filter for state estimation in linear systems. To perform the estimation in non-linear systems, methods such as the Unscented Kalman Filter and the Particle Filter were developed. The Unscented Kalman Filter uses the Unscented transform to approximate the different distributions to a Gaussian, allowing it to have certain similarities with the Kalman Filter. The Particle Filter uses Monte Carlo methods to generate samples of arbitrary probability distributions in various dimensions, which are propagated through the system in order to approximate values of the new probability distribution. Finally, a set of examples are made that allow to compare the accuracy and computational speed of the different filters and evaluate their performance.
